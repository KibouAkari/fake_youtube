# YouTube Web Spoofing (Local Redirect)

This project demonstrates a local DNS spoofing setup that redirects traffic from `youtube.com` to a custom-hosted web page. The spoofed site visually replicates the YouTube interface in dark mode and includes a download button styled as a legitimate app prompt. It is intended for use in a fully controlled network environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

### 1. Host the Spoofed Website

Use Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server to host the page:

```bash
python -m http.server 80
```

Or use any local server (nginx, Apache, XAMPP) that can serve `index.html` on port 80.

> Ensure your system's firewall or security software allows port 80 traffic.

### 2. Redirect YouTube Domains Locally

On your router (e.g., ASUS ROG Rapture GT6), configure DNS spoofing or redirection to reroute `youtube.com` and `www.youtube.com` to your local server‚Äôs IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

> This will affect all devices on your network unless filtered.

### 3. Build the Executable

The `youtube.py` script creates a basic GUI message when executed. To compile it into an `.exe`, use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/):

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=youtube-logo.ico youtube.py
```

After a successful build, you will find `youtube.exe` inside the `dist/` directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Antivirus software may flag unknown executables. This file is safe and performs no harmful actions.

## üé® Visual Design Details

- Background: `#0f0f0f` (YouTube‚Äôs dark mode tone)
- Text and buttons: `#f0f0f0`
- Minimalist layout, no navigation bar
- Language selection toggle (English, German, Chinese)
- Download button labeled to suggest a desktop YouTube app

The spoofed UI is responsive and made to resemble the genuine YouTube experience in dark mode.
